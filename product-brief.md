## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Procurement teams spend 60-70% of their time on manual supplier follow-ups via email and phone

- Scattered communication history across email, phone logs, and spreadsheets makes it difficult to track PO status
- Reactive approach to supplier management results in last-minute escalations and firefighting
- No systematic way to identify high-risk suppliers or problematic contacts before issues arise

**Business Impact:**
- Production delays due to late deliveries
- Excessive time spent on administrative tasks instead of strategic sourcing
- Inability to proactively manage supplier relationships
- Lost leverage in supplier negotiations due to lack of performance data
